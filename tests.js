// assert is very similar to how you use expect, but offers

/**
 *          YOU MUST 'npm install' IN YOUR TERMINAL TO INSTALL MOCHA/CHAI 
 *          FROM THE DEPENDENCIES IN YOUR PACKAGE.JSON
 * 
 *  Step 1: Create a describe code block that describes what you expect the code to do.
 *  Step 2: Copy/Paste your debugged code from week6Lab.js into the describe block (exclude the final console.log())
 *  Step 3: Create tests using expect/assert to test for expected outputs. Use multiple cases.
 *          If you're testing against an array/object - read the documentation on .deep/.deepEquals
 *
 *  Note:   Mocha/Chai is currently set up to only run in your given index.html. 
 *          expect/assert are given to you at the top of the code. 
 * 
 *          By default, the tests will pass unless you give it code to test against.
